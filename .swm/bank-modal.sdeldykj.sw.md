## **BankModal Component Documentation**

The `BankModal` component is a React component that represents a modal for adding or editing bank information. This modal provides a user-friendly interface for users to input and update details about a bank. It leverages the `useFormik` hook for form management and receives data through props to control its visibility and interactions.

### **Import Statements**

```
jsxCopy code
```

`import React from "react";`

`import { Icon } from "@iconify/react";`

`import { useFormik } from "formik";`

`import { bankData } from "./BankMaster";`

*   `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

*   `@iconify/react`: A library for using icons in React applications.

*   `useFormik`: A hook from the Formik library for managing forms.

*   `bankData`: The array containing bank information from the `BankMaster` component.

### **BankModal Component**

A functional component named `BankModal` that renders the modal for adding/editing bank data. Here are the main sections of the component:

1.  **Formik Form Setup**

    The component uses the `useFormik` hook to manage form state and submissions. It initializes the form with initial values for all input fields and an `onSubmit` handler that logs the form values and adds them to the `bankData` array.

2.  **Visibility Control**

    The `visible` prop determines whether the modal is displayed. If it's `false`, the component returns `null`, effectively hiding the modal.

3.  **Rendering**

    The `BankModal` component renders the following elements:

    *   A fixed overlay with a semi-transparent background that covers the entire viewport.

    *   The modal content container with a gray background, centered on the screen.

    *   The modal header with a blue background, displaying "Bank Master."

    *   A grid layout containing input fields for various bank details.

    *   Input fields for bank information such as ID, name, branch, account type, etc.

    *   Dropdowns and input fields for selecting account and currency types.

    *   Radio buttons for selecting authorized person roles.

    *   "Save" and "Close" buttons for submitting and closing the modal.

### **Additional Notes**

*   The modal is displayed when the `visible` prop is `true`, and it's hidden when the `visible` prop is `false`.

*   The `useFormik` hook simplifies form handling, validation, and submission.

*   The input fields and dropdowns are populated with values from the `formik` object.

*   The "Save" button triggers the form submission, logging the entered data and adding it to the `bankData` array.

*   The "Close" button, when clicked, triggers the `onClick` function provided through props to close the modal.

This component provides users with an interactive modal for adding and editing bank details. It streamlines form handling using the Formik library and offers a straightforward interface for entering and managing data.
