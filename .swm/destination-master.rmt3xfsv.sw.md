## **DestinationMaster Component Documentation**

The `DestinationMaster` component is a React component designed to display and manage destination data. It provides a user interface for viewing, searching, and interacting with destination information. This component incorporates dynamic column visibility, search functionality, and the ability to open a modal to add or edit destination details. It is expected to be used within a broader application to manage destination-related settings.

### **Dependencies**

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

*   **@iconify/react**: A library for using customizable icons in React applications.

### **Component State**

*   `isModalOpen` (boolean): Controls the visibility of the `DestinationModal` component.

*   `filteredData` (array): Contains filtered destination data based on search input.

*   `columnVisibility` (object): Manages the visibility status of individual table columns.

*   `showDropdown` (boolean): Controls the visibility of the column visibility dropdown menu.

*   `selectedColumns` (array): Contains the names of selected columns for display.

*   `veDest` (boolean): Controls the visibility of the view/edit modal.

*   `edit` (boolean): Indicates whether the modal should be in edit mode.

*   `id` (number): Stores the ID of the currently selected destination for the modal.

*   `menuOpen` (boolean): Controls the visibility of the action menu.

### **Component Functions**

*   `handleSearchChange`: Filters the destination data based on search input.

*   `toggleColumn`: Toggles the visibility status of a column.

*   `selectAllColumns`: Selects all columns for display.

*   `deselectAllColumns`: Deselects all columns.

*   `getColumnMaxWidth`: Calculates the maximum width of a table column.

*   `getTextWidth`: Calculates the width of a given text using canvas.

### **User Interface Elements**

*   **Company Settings / Destination Master Banner**: Displays the title of the component.

*   **Column Visibility Dropdown**: Provides options to select and deselect columns for display.

*   **Add Dest. Button**: Opens the `DestinationModal` component for adding new destinations.

*   **Action Menu Button**: Displays a menu with options to perform actions such as copying, exporting, and printing.

*   **Table**: Displays destination data in a tabular format.

*   **Search Inputs**: Located in the table header, allow users to search within columns.

*   **Icons**: Allow users to view, edit, or delete destination entries.

### **Modal Integration**

The component utilizes the `DestinationModal` component to add or edit destination details. It manages the visibility of this modal using the `isModalOpen`, `veDest`, and `edit` states. The `id` state is used to pass the ID of the selected destination to the modal for editing purposes.

### **Menu Click Outside Handling**

The component includes an effect that listens for clicks outside the action menu, closing it when a click occurs outside its boundaries.

### **Column Visibility**

Users can customize the visibility of columns using the column visibility dropdown. They can select or deselect individual columns, or choose to display all or none of them.

### **Responsive Styling**

The component has responsive styling that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining alignment and spacing of UI elements.
