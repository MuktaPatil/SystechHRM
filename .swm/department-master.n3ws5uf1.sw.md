## **Department Master Component Documentation**

The `DepartmentMaster` component is a React component that provides a comprehensive user interface for managing departments within a company. It displays a table containing department information, allows users to search, filter, and perform actions on department records, and provides options for customizing the visibility of table columns. The component includes functionality for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting departments.

### **Dependencies**

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

*   **React**: The core library for building user interfaces in React applications.

*   **@iconify/react**: A library for using icons within React components.

### **Data Initialization**

The component initializes the `departments` array containing a list of department objects. Each department object represents a department within a company and includes attributes such as `deptID`, `deptName`, `companyBranchName`, `deptType`, `deptHead`, and more.

### **User Interface and Features**

The component provides the following features:

1.  **Column Visibility Control**: Users can control the visibility of table columns by clicking the "Column Visibility" button. A dropdown menu appears allowing users to select or deselect columns for display.

2.  **Add Department**: Users can add new departments by clicking the "Add Dept." button. This opens a modal (`DepartmentModal`) where they can input department details and save the new record.

3.  **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for departments by entering search terms in the input fields at the top of each column. The table updates to show only matching results.

4.  **Action Buttons**: For each department row, action buttons are available to view, edit, and delete the department record. The "eye" icon opens a detailed view of the department, the "edit" icon opens an editable view of the department, and the "delete" icon initiates the deletion of the department.

5.  **Export Options**: A menu button with the icon "menu" provides options to export the table data in various formats, including copy, CSV, Excel, PDF, and print.

### **Component States and Functions**

*   `isModalOpen`: A state variable that controls the visibility of the `DepartmentModal` for adding new departments.

*   `filteredData`: A state variable that holds the filtered department data based on search inputs.

*   `columnVisibility`: A state variable that controls the visibility of each table column.

*   `showDropdown`: A state variable that toggles the visibility of the column visibility dropdown menu.

*   `selectedColumns`: A state variable that stores the list of selected columns to be displayed.

*   `veDept`: A state variable that controls the visibility of the `VEDept` component for viewing and editing department details.

*   `edit`: A state variable that determines whether the `VEDept` component is in edit mode.

*   `Did`: A state variable that holds the department ID to be passed to the `VEDept` component.

The component includes several functions to handle column visibility, toggle dropdowns, manage selected columns, and handle clicking outside of dropdown menus.

### **Table Rendering**

The component renders a table containing department records with the following columns:

*   Actions (view, edit, delete icons)

*   ID

*   Customizable columns based on user-selected visibility settings

### **Responsiveness and Styling**

The component includes responsive styling with various CSS classes to ensure proper alignment, spacing, and visibility of components on different screen sizes. It also utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling components.
