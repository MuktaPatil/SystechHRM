## **CompanyModal Component Documentation**

The `CompanyModal` component is a reusable React component responsible for rendering a modal dialog for adding or editing company information. This modal allows users to input various details about a company, such as its name, sector, nature of business, status, and more. It uses the `useFormik` hook for form management and leverages state to control checkbox and input values.

### **Import Statements**

import { useFormik } from 'formik';

import React from 'react';

import { useState } from 'react';

import { compData } from './CompMaster';

*   `useFormik`: A popular form library for managing form state in React.

*   `compData`: An array containing company data (imported from `CompMaster`).

### **CompanyModal Component**

The `CompanyModal` component is designed to be included in other components and accepts two props: `visible` and `onClick`.

1.  **State Management**

    *   `statusCheck`: Manages the status checkbox value (Active or Inactive).

    *   `singleBranchCheck`: Manages the single branch checkbox value (Active or Inactive).

2.  **Form Handling using useFormik**

    The component uses the `useFormik` hook to manage form state, validation, and submission.

    *   `initialValues`: Defines the initial state of the form fields.

    *   `onSubmit`: Handles form submission by logging the form values and pushing them to the `compData` array.

3.  **Conditional Rendering**

    If the `visible` prop is `false`, the modal is not rendered.

4.  **Modal Interface**

    The modal dialog contains several input fields and checkboxes for capturing company information:

    *   Company ID (`companyId`)

    *   Company Name (`companyName`)

    *   Company Short Name (`shortName`)

    *   Company Sector (`companySector`)

    *   Nature of Business (`natureOfBusiness`)

    *   Status (`statusCheck`)

    *   Logo (file upload) (`logo`)

    *   Single Branch (`singleBranchCheck`)

5.  **Event Handling Functions**

    *   `onChange` handlers are used to update the corresponding state when checkboxes are clicked.

6.  **Rendering**

    The modal dialog is rendered with various input fields, checkboxes, and buttons.

    *   The modal background creates a dimmed overlay.

    *   The modal content is contained within a centered box.

    *   Input fields for various company details.

    *   Checkboxes for status and single branch.

    *   Buttons for saving the form and closing the modal.

### **Additional Notes**

*   The `CompanyModal` component encapsulates the form and logic required to capture company data.

*   It provides an interface for both adding and editing company information.

*   The form uses the `formik` library to manage form state and validation.

*   The component doesn't perform actual data storage; it only collects and logs form data.
