## **Cost Center Modal Component Documentation**

The `CostCenterModal` component is a React component that provides a modal for adding new cost center records. It allows users to input the details of a new cost center, such as its ID, name, remark, and status, and then save the new record. The modal can be triggered to be visible or hidden based on the `visible` prop passed to it. When the user is done adding the record, they can close the modal using the provided close button.

### **Dependencies**

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

*   **React**: The core library for building user interfaces in React applications.

*   **useFormik**: A library for managing form state and validation in React forms.

*   **costCenters**: An array of cost centers imported from the `CostCenterMaster` component (assumed to be a parent component).

### **Props**

*   `visible`: A boolean prop that controls the visibility of the modal.

*   `onClick`: A callback function that is executed when the close button is clicked.

### **State and Form Management**

The component utilizes the `useFormik` hook to manage form state and form submission. It initializes the form with the following initial values:

*   `costCenterID`: An empty string.

*   `costCenterName`: An empty string.

*   `remark`: An empty string.

*   `status`: An empty string.

The `onSubmit` handler of the form is responsible for logging the form values and pushing the new cost center record into the `costCenters` array.

Additionally, the component uses local state to manage the status checkbox value.

### **Rendering**

The component renders the following elements:

*   A backdrop that darkens the background when the modal is open.

*   The modal itself, contained within a centered box.

*   A title section displaying "Cost Center Master."

*   Form inputs for cost center ID, name, remark, and a status checkbox.

*   Buttons for saving the record and closing the modal.

### **Event Handling**

The component handles the following events:

*   Form submission when the "Save" button is clicked.

*   Changes in form inputs using the `handleChange` function provided by `useFormik`.

*   Click event on the status checkbox to toggle its value using the `handleStatusChange` function.

*   Click event on the close button to execute the `onClick` callback passed as a prop.

### **Form Validation**

This code snippet does not include form validation logic. If form validation is required, you would need to add validation rules and error handling to the `useFormik` configuration.
