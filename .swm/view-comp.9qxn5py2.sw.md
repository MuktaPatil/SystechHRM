## **Company Edit Modal Component Documentation**

The `VEModal` component is a React component that serves as an edit modal for managing and updating company records in the Company Master section of an application's Company Settings. This modal allows users to view and modify the details of a specific company based on the selected company's ID.

### **Dependencies**

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

*   **formik**: A library for managing forms and form validations in React applications.

*   **react**: The core library for building user interfaces in React.

### **Component Behavior**

The `VEModal` component is designed to perform the following tasks:

1.  **Data Display and Editing**: Allows users to view and edit details of a company's information.

2.  **Form Handling**: Utilizes the Formik library to manage form state and validation of the entered data.

3.  **Checkbox Interaction**: Provides checkboxes to manage the active status and single branch status of the company.

4.  **Image Upload**: Enables users to upload company logos via file input.

5.  **Save and Close**: Provides buttons to save edited information and close the modal.

### **Props**

The `VEModal` component accepts the following props:

*   **visible** (boolean): Determines whether the modal should be visible or hidden.

*   **onClick** (function): Callback function to handle the close button click event.

*   **edit** (boolean): Indicates whether the modal is in edit mode or not.

*   **ID** (number): The ID of the company being edited.

### **Modal Content**

The modal content consists of sections for different fields related to the company:

*   **Company ID**: A numerical field displaying the company's identification, disabled unless in edit mode.

*   **Company Name**: A text field for entering or displaying the company's name, disabled unless in edit mode.

*   **Company Short Name**: A text field for entering or displaying the company's short name, disabled unless in edit mode.

*   **Company Sector**: A text field for entering or displaying the company's sector, disabled unless in edit mode.

*   **Nature of Business**: A textarea for entering or displaying the nature of the company's business, disabled unless in edit mode.

*   **Status**: A checkbox indicating whether the company is active, available in both edit and non-edit modes.

*   **Logo**: A file input for uploading a company logo, available in edit mode.

*   **Single Branch**: A checkbox indicating whether the company operates as a single branch, available in edit mode.

### **Form Handling**

The component uses Formik to manage form state and validation. When the form is submitted, the entered data is logged to the console. For edit mode, the initial values of the form fields are populated with the details of the selected company using the provided `ID`.

### **User Interaction**

Users can interact with the modal by filling out the form fields, checking/unchecking checkboxes, uploading a logo, and clicking the "Save" or "Close" buttons. The "Save" button is only shown when the modal is in edit mode. Clicking the "Close" button triggers the provided `onClick` callback to close the modal.
