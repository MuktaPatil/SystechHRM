## **Department Modal Component Documentation**

The `DepartmentModal` component is a React component designed to provide a user interface for adding new departments or editing existing department details. It utilizes the Formik library for form management and validation and offers options for entering various attributes of a department, such as its name, type, group, head, sub-head, and more. This modal can be invoked to manage department data and is intended to be used in conjunction with a broader application, as indicated by its usage of the `departments` array from the `DepartmentMaster` module.

### **Dependencies**

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

*   **React**: The core library for building user interfaces in React applications.

*   **Formik**: A library for managing forms and form validation in React applications.

### **Input Properties**

*   `visible` (boolean): Controls the visibility of the modal.

*   `onClick` (function): Callback function to handle the modal close event.

### **Component State**

*   `status` (boolean): Represents the status of the department (active or inactive).

### **Component Functions**

*   `handleStatusChange`: A function that toggles the `status` state when the "Active" checkbox is clicked.

### **Formik Configuration**

The component uses Formik to manage form inputs, validation, and submission. The `useFormik` hook is employed to initialize the form with initial values and submission handling. The initial values correspond to various department attributes, including ID, name, branch, parent department, type, group, head, sub-head, cost center, staff strength, worker strength, remarks, and status.

Upon form submission, the `onSubmit` callback is triggered. The submitted data is logged to the console, added to the `departments` array (assuming this array is maintained in the parent component), and an alert message is shown indicating a successful addition.

### **User Interface and Elements**

The modal provides an interface for entering department details and includes the following form elements:

*   Department ID (number input)

*   Department Name (text input)

*   Company Branch Name (select input)

*   Parent Department Name (select input)

*   Department Type (radio button input)

*   Department Group (select input)

*   Department Head (select input)

*   Department Sub Head (select input)

*   Cost Center (select input)

*   Standard Staff Strength (text input)

*   Standard Worker Strength (text input)

*   Remarks (text input)

*   Status (checkbox input)

### **Modal Layout and Styling**

The modal is displayed as an overlay with a semi-transparent backdrop. It features a centralized content container with rounded corners. The form elements are organized using CSS grid for a clean and structured layout.

Buttons for saving changes and closing the modal are placed at the bottom of the modal.

### **Responsiveness**

The modal has responsive styling that adjusts to different screen sizes, maintaining proper alignment and spacing of components.
